Dictionaries or associative arrays are the perfect way to store data structured when they don't need to deliver out-of-the-box logic. If you need logic like calculation or so, maybe consider using a class and create objects. If you need to just store plain data, use these dictionaries.
Avoid using arrays with integer keys, because it makes your code less intuitive and others need to first understand which index has which meaning.
