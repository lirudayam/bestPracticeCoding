It's very important to give variables an understandable name. They should be simple and easy to understand. Furthermore, your naming guidelines shall be continuously used.
If you use camelCase, PascalCase or snake_case, make sure to stay consistent. Other programming languages (e.g. ABAP) require to define the variable scope with a leading char, such as 'g' for global or 'l' for local.<br /><br/>
However, in typeless programming languages (e.g. JavaScript) it makes sense to define the intended data type by a leading char (even through this does not give the variable the intended data type):
<ul>
  <li>i for integer</li>
  <li>b for boolean</li>
  <li>s for string</li>
  <li>o for object</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>
<br />
This is very important when you manipulate your variable or use it for operations or concatenations.
