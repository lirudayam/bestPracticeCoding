Most languages require to give a variable at the initialization a data type. This is important for the program to reserve resources when this variable is been declared later.
So it's important to be clear which data type this variable shall use. <b>Keep it simple</b>, give indexes just integers or flags just the boolean type. If it is a more complex data structure consider using dictionaries or classes.<br /><br />
Nonetheless, there are many typeless programming languages. Be aware of the consequences when using them especially for comparison operations.
PHP 7.4 has introduces typed properties. Whenever it appears useful to outline the data type, do so!
