# Best Practice Coding: The Open Experience Project
This shall be a guide for beginners, intermediates as well as professionals to adapt best practices and to enhance code quality. Feel free to contribute! Since GitHub archives open source repositories on 02/02/2020 in ice, I want everyone to contribute to this open source project or as I call it open experience project. Sharing experience is one of the most underestimated things, especially when it's about sharing skills. But I learned that only this way everyone can benefit.

PERSONAL BENEFIT IS LIMITED, MANKIND BENEFITS ARE UNLIMITED!

Go ahead and contribute to this project and share your knowledge with the entire community. I keep on adding new units. Feel free to enhance, extend or add new content, maybe also correct my ideas. Make this project huge and make it a gateway for everyone to quality coding.

## How to add new units
1. Create a new folder under bp_content (best copy one existing one)
2. Add a new entry to units.json file and viola, it's done

Of course, you can also enhance the design or the user experience. Keep it simple and easy.

Thanks to every contributor,
